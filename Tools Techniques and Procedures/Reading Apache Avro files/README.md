Reading Apache Avro files
=========================

Description
-----------
Apache Avro is, like Apache Parquet and Apache ORC, a storage format widely used in Big Data environments.  
As an attacker, you might be facing this format after getting access to the datalake.  

All instructions to read this format are available [here](http://www.michael-noll.com/blog/2013/03/17/reading-and-writing-avro-files-from-the-command-line/).  
The current standalone jar provided here is `avro-tools-1.8.1.jar`.
